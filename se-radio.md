# Favorite Software Engineering Podcasts #

In 2008, after suffering a "youn man's" stroke, I discovered [Software Engineering Radio podcast](https://se-radio.net/).

At that time, as a result of suffering significant brain damage, I found it very difficult to read technical papers and books.

> An aside.  I had lost many nouns.  The words I had to re-learn included "fork", "spoon", and "knife" and the names of the human limbs.  When I resumed my work as a Linux/C programmer, I had some frustrating moments attempting to *remember* those silly two-character-name command line tools.

After many years of recovery I once again enjoy reading; I still enjoy listening to Software Engineering podcasts.
