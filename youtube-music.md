    * Found this channel when searching for performances of Boccherini music
        * I think I learned about this music when I took Music Lectures at the University of Arkansas,
          but I was reminded of this music while watching the file >Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
    * [L. Boccherini. Musica notturna including La Ritirata di Madrid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oolXAoDUKoU)
* [Dennis Schutze](https://www.youtube.com/@dennisschuetzeband)
    * I stumbled across this channel while looking for classical music performed on a ukulele
    * [J.S. Bach: Minuet in G-Major for ukulele & guitar (BWV Anh. 116)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POdxVKMVGSk)
